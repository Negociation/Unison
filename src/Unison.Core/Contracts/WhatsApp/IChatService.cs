// Pinning and marking read are account-wide facts, not local preferences: the
// phone and every other linked device are meant to agree, so both of these go
// out on the wire and come back as app state. The local copy is kept anyway,
// because the list has to sort and draw before any of that round trips - and
// has to keep working with no connection at all.
